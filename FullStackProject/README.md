# dropWizard
DropWizard API

To build the project run mvn package
Then run the project as a java application.  You need to add program arguments server config.yaml -- 
(java -jar [jar file] server config.yaml)


The server arguments are set up to use port 9000.  If it runs successfully, open browser and connect to localhost:9000/GWlist.html.  
If the web page opens then everything is working.
